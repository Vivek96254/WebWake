# WebWake
 A python script to keep your website awake

 - For free hosted websites that have a cold start, use this to keep your website awake. The default timer is set to 14 minutes. 
 - Looking for a free local lightweight uptime monitor, this is another go to.
 - Want to increase traffic on your website, this app can also do that.

[WINDOWS ONLY]
To convert it into an .exe executable file use the command :
```linux
 pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile web_noti_v4.py
```
In case you need the logs console just use :
```linux
 pyinstaller --onefile web_noti_v4.py
```

To autostart the app on login, 
1. Press Windows key + R
2. Type 'shell:startup' (This will open the Startup folder)
3. Place the shortcut of the executable in this folder


## Added a GUI version as well, easier to change the website, start the script or stop it with the logs as well.
